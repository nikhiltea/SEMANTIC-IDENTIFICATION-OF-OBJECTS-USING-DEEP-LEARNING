# SEMANTIC-IDENTIFICATION-OF-OBJECTS-USING-DEEP-LEARNING

This project combines a React-based user interface with TensorFlow.js for real-time sign language translation. It leverages a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify hand gestures captured via webcam.

## Features

*   *React UI:* Modern user interface built with React.
*   *Webcam Integration:* Captures video from the webcam for gesture recognition.
*   *k-NN Classification (TensorFlow.js):* Uses TensorFlow.js and the deeplearn-knn-image-classifier library (or similar) to classify hand gestures.
*   *Customizable Gestures:*  Allows users to train the model with custom gestures and words.
*   *Text Output:* Displays the translated words as text.
*   *TensorFlow.js Object Detection (Placeholder):* Includes a placeholder component for integrating more advanced object detection models (requires setup and compatible model).

## Technologies Used

*   *React:* JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   *TensorFlow.js:* JavaScript library for machine learning in the browser.
*   **deeplearn-knn-image-classifier (or similar):** For k-NN image classification.
*   **react-router-dom:** For routing in the React application.
*   *Firebase:* For user authentication (login/logout).
*   *Stripe:* For payment processing (integration example).
*   *HTML & CSS:* For structuring and styling the user interface.

## Setup and Installation

1.  *Clone the Repository:*

    bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd sign-language-translator-react
    

2.  *Install Dependencies:*

    bash
    npm install    # or yarn install
    

    Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.  Install necessary packages if they are not included.

    bash
    npm install react react-dom react-router-dom @tensorflow/tfjs deeplearn-knn-image-classifier @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js firebase
    

3.  *Firebase Configuration:*

    *   Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console ([https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)).
    *   Enable authentication (e.g., email/password).
    *   Get your Firebase configuration object from the Firebase Console.
    *   Replace the placeholder values in your firebase.js file with your actual Firebase configuration.

4.  *Stripe Configuration:*

    *   Create a Stripe account at ([https://stripe.com/](https://stripe.com/)).
    *   Obtain your Stripe publishable key.
    *   Replace the placeholder value in App.js with your Stripe publishable key.

5.  *Run the Application:*

    bash
    npm start   # or yarn start
    

    This will start the React development server. Open your browser and navigate to the address provided (usually http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

1.  *Webcam Access:* Grant the application access to your webcam when prompted.
2.  *User Authentication:* Create an account or log in using Firebase authentication.
3.  *Gesture Training (k-NN):*
    *   Follow the on-screen instructions to train the k-NN classifier with your own sign language gestures.
    *   Add new words and associate them with specific hand gestures.
    *   Provide multiple training examples for each gesture to improve accuracy.
4.  *Real-Time Translation:* Once you have trained the gestures, the application will attempt to translate your hand gestures in real-time, displaying the translated text on the screen.
5.  *Object Detection (Placeholder):* The object detection component is a placeholder and requires further configuration (see "TensorFlow.js Object Detection Setup" below).

## TensorFlow.js Object Detection Setup (Placeholder)

The TensorFlow object detection component is a placeholder and requires additional steps to set up.

1.  *Choose a TF.js Compatible Model:* Select a TensorFlow.js-compatible object detection model. You can find pre-trained models on TensorFlow Hub:  [https://tfhub.dev/s?deployment-format=tfjs](https://tfhub.dev/s?deployment-format=tfjs)
2.  *Integrate the Model Loading Code:*  Replace the commented-out lines in the TensorFlowComponent in App.js with the appropriate code to load the model.  You'll typically use tf.loadGraphModel or similar functions.
3.  *Provide an Image Element:*  Create an HTML <img> element in your component, and pass a reference to this element to the TensorFlow.js code. The tf.browser.fromPixels() function is used to convert the image to a tensor.
4.  *Run Inference:*  Call the model's detect() or similar function to perform object detection on the image tensor.
5.  *Display Results:*  Parse the output of the model and display the detected objects and their bounding boxes on the screen.

Important Note: The file paths used in the commented-out TensorFlow code (e.g., /content/training_demo/...) are not valid in a browser environment.  TensorFlow.js models must be loaded from a web server.
